# First Idea Draft

## Use-cases
* Frames/Images with QR Code
    * Images triggered
    * Swipe or select specific image
    * Same with video
    * Scale, rotate
    * Gimmick: 3D model of an image (dead cat?)
    * Voice messages as well and option to reply or interact?
* HoloLens and QR Code as support for technical difficulties
    * TV remote control
    * Reset router
    * Cables

## Implementation Thoughts
* HoloLens with MRTK-Package
* All interactions should be possible with speech as well
* Eyetracking
* Rays for immobile people (grab things to you)
* Personalization (e.g. speech recognition on/off or "Alexa...", scaling, ...)
